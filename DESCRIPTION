Package: cellProfiles
Title: Generate Cell Profile Demographs 
Version: 3.0
Authors@R: person("Todd", "Cameron", email = "tacameron@berkeley.edu", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: This R package will take a series of fluorescent profiles acquired in ImageJ/Fiji (or MicrobeTracker), arrange them from shortest to longest, then use Hadley Wickamâ€™s ggplot2 to plot the profiles out as a vertical stack. Each horizontal line represents the fluorescence intensity profile of a single cell. By ordering cells according to length, general localization patterns over the cell cycle can be easily visualized..
Depends: R (>= 3.3.2)
